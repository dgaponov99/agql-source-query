# AGQL Source Query Fork

This is a minimal, standalone fork of the [Valve Source Query](https://github.com/ribasco/async-gamequery-lib/tree/master/protocols/valve/source/query) protocol module from [async-gamequery-lib](https://github.com/ribasco/async-gamequery-lib) by [ribasco](https://github.com/ribasco), originally licensed under the Apache-2.0 License.

## Changes

- Extracted only the `protocols/valve/source/query` module.
- Refactored for standalone usage.
- Add a decoder for the [GoldSrc](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/GoldSrc) response of the [A2S_INFO](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries) query
